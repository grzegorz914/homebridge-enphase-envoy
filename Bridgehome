For any branch you want to require a PR on you'd target that branch or any branches that you'd like to protect.

For example if you were to target **/* you could protect every branch recursively and then define the setting in Require a pull request before merging that are relevant for you.

If you only wanted to protect develop and no other branch create one branch protection rule for that branch and define the relevant PR rules.

To have multiple rules on one branch they are exclusive of each other, so if you have rules for * and develop they will not overlap.

Hope this helps! And thanks for being patient we get tons of questions here and sometimes they slip by @mmu094
